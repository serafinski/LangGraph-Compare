They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. North America is home to several species of sturgeon, each with unique characteristics and conservation statuses. This report provides an overview of the main sturgeon species found in North America, their distribution, and notable features.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries of the western United States and Canada.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling species seen in inshore waters and estuaries.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Not specifically detailed, but known to be large.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, primarily in the eastern United States.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Up to 4 feet long and weighing around 50 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling fish in rivers and estuaries of the eastern U.S.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered, with a very limited distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nMany sturgeon species in North America are threatened or endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration and legal protections to prevent overfishing.\n\n**Chart: Distribution of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                                             | Size               |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Various river systems)                       | Large              |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | Eastern Coast (New Brunswick to Florida)                 | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River system, Alabama                             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNorth American sturgeons are significant both ecologically and economically. Understanding their biology and distribution is crucial for their conservation. Continued research and conservation efforts are essential to ensure their survival in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00a6Search\u00a2id\u00c0\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. North America is home to several species of sturgeon, each with unique characteristics and conservation statuses. This report provides an overview of the main sturgeon species found in North America, their distribution, and notable features.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries of the western United States and Canada.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling species seen in inshore waters and estuaries.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Not specifically detailed, but known to be large.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, primarily in the eastern United States.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Up to 4 feet long and weighing around 50 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling fish in rivers and estuaries of the eastern U.S.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered, with a very limited distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nMany sturgeon species in North America are threatened or endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration and legal protections to prevent overfishing.\n\n**Chart: Distribution of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                                             | Size               |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Various river systems)                       | Large              |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | Eastern Coast (New Brunswick to Florida)                 | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River system, Alabama                             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNorth American sturgeons are significant both ecologically and economically. Understanding their biology and distribution is crucial for their conservation.

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. North America is home to several species of sturgeon, each with unique characteristics and conservation statuses. This report provides an overview of the main sturgeon species found in North America, their distribution, and notable features.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries of the western United States and Canada.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling species seen in inshore waters and estuaries.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Not specifically detailed, but known to be large.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, primarily in the eastern United States.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Up to 4 feet long and weighing around 50 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling fish in rivers and estuaries of the eastern U.S.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered, with a very limited distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nMany sturgeon species in North America are threatened or endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration and legal protections to prevent overfishing.\n\n**Chart: Distribution of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                                             | Size               |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Various river systems)                       | Large              |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | Eastern Coast (New Brunswick to Florida)                 | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River system, Alabama                             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNorth American sturgeons are significant both ecologically and economically. Understanding their biology and distribution is crucial for their conservation. Continued research and conservation efforts are essential to ensure their survival in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00a6Search\u00a2id\u00d9$d0eb9592-3b9b-48eb-95da-8a5f471fc2f7\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. North America is home to several species of sturgeon, each with unique characteristics and conservation statuses. This report provides an overview of the main sturgeon species found in North America, their distribution, and notable features.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries of the western United States and Canada.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling species seen in inshore waters and estuaries.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Not specifically detailed, but known to be large.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, primarily in the eastern United States.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Up to 4 feet long and weighing around 50 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling fish in rivers and estuaries of the eastern U.S.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered, with a very limited distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nMany sturgeon species in North America are threatened or endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration and legal protections to prevent overfishing.\n\n**Chart: Distribution of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                                             | Size               |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Various river systems)                       | Large              |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | Eastern Coast (New Brunswick to Florida)                 | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River system, Alabama                             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNorth American sturgeons are significant both ecologically and economically. Understanding their biology and distribution is crucial for their conservation. Continued research and conservation efforts are essential to ensure their survival in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00a6Search\u00a2id\u00d9$d0eb9592-3b9b-48eb-95da-8a5f471fc2f7\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. North America is home to several species of sturgeon, each with unique characteristics and conservation statuses. This report provides an overview of the main sturgeon species found in North America, their distribution, and notable features.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries of the western United States and Canada.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling species seen in inshore waters and estuaries.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Not specifically detailed, but known to be large.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, primarily in the eastern United States.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Up to 4 feet long and weighing around 50 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling fish in rivers and estuaries of the eastern U.S.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered, with a very limited distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nMany sturgeon species in North America are threatened or endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration and legal protections to prevent overfishing.\n\n**Chart: Distribution of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                                             | Size               |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Various river systems)                       | Large              |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | Eastern Coast (New Brunswick to Florida)                 | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River system, Alabama                             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNorth American sturgeons are significant both ecologically and economically. Understanding their biology and distribution is crucial for their conservation. Continued research and conservation efforts are essential to ensure their survival in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00a6Search\u00a2id\u00d9$d0eb9592-3b9b-48eb-95da-8a5f471fc2f7\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. North America is home to several species of sturgeon, each with unique characteristics and conservation statuses. This report provides an overview of the main sturgeon species found in North America, their distribution, and notable features.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries of the western United States and Canada.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast from Mexico to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling species seen in inshore waters and estuaries.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Not specifically detailed, but known to be large.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, primarily in the eastern United States.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Up to 4 feet long and weighing around 50 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Bottom-dwelling fish in rivers and estuaries of the eastern U.S.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered, with a very limited distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nMany sturgeon species in North America are threatened or endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration and legal protections to prevent overfishing.\n\n**Chart: Distribution of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                                             | Size               |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (Mexico to Alaska)                            | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Various river systems)                       | Large              |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | Eastern Coast (New Brunswick to Florida)                 | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River system, Alabama                             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNorth American sturgeons are significant both ecologically and economically. Understanding their biology and distribution is crucial for their conservation. Continued research and conservation efforts are essential to ensure their survival in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00a6Search\u00a2id\u00d9$d0eb9592-3b9b-48eb-95da-8a5f471fc2f7\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.",

These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00c0\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution.

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution.

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution.

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant.

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles.

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution.

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant.

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant.

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00c0\u00a2id\u00d9$8224dd6a-572c-441e-92ce-d9c829814f8f\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

However, I can summarize key details about North American sturgeon based on existing knowledge:\n\n**Research Report: North American Sturgeon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSturgeons are a group of fish known for their ancient lineage, distinctive bony plates, and elongated bodies. They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles. Continued research and targeted conservation efforts are essential to preserve these ancient fish species in North American waters.\u00b1additional_kwargs\u0080\u00b1response_metadata\u0080\u00a4type\u00a5human\u00a4name\u00aaWebScraper\u00a2id\u00c0\u00a7example\u00c2\u00b3model_validate_json"

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant. Their conservation is critical due to their declining populations and ecological roles.

They are primarily found in the temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with several species inhabiting North American waters. These species are notable for their size, lifespan, and ecological roles.\n\n**Species Overview**\n\n1. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\n   - **Size:** Can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Inhabit large rivers and estuaries.\n\n2. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\n   - **Size:** Can reach up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds.\n   - **Distribution:** Occurs along the west coast from California to Alaska.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer coastal marine environments, estuaries, and rivers.\n\n3. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\n   - **Size:** Known for substantial size, historically reaching up to 14 feet.\n   - **Distribution:** Found along the eastern coast of North America.\n   - **Habitat:** Rivers and estuaries, with significant populations in the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River.\n\n4. **Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)**\n   - **Size:** Smaller, up to 4 feet long.\n   - **Distribution:** Eastern coast of North America, from New Brunswick to Florida.\n   - **Habitat:** Prefer tidal rivers and estuarine environments.\n\n5. **Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)**\n   - **Status:** Critically endangered with a very restricted distribution.\n   - **Habitat:** Historically found in the Mobile River system in Alabama.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nSturgeon species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many are listed as threatened or endangered, prompting various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fishing regulations.\n\n**Chart: Distribution and Size of North American Sturgeon**\n\n| Species               | Distribution                      | Size Range         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| White Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 20 feet      |\n| Green Sturgeon        | West Coast (CA to AK)             | Up to 7 feet       |\n| Atlantic Sturgeon     | East Coast (Chesapeake, Hudson)   | Up to 14 feet      |\n| Shortnose Sturgeon    | East Coast (NB to FL)             | Up to 4 feet       |\n| Alabama Sturgeon      | Mobile River, Alabama             | Critically Endangered|\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSturgeons are ecologically and economically significant.
