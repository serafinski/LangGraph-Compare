Purpose
*******
This Python package facilitates the parsing of run logs generated by `LangGraph <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_. During execution, logs are stored in an SQLite database in an encoded format `(using msgpack)`. These logs are then decoded and exported to a :code:`json` format. Subsequently, the :code:`json` files are transformed into :code:`csv` files for further analysis.

Once in :code:`csv` format, the data can be analyzed using methods from the `pm4py <https://processintelligence.solutions/static/api/2.7.11/index.html>`_ library. These methods calculate specific statistics related to the multi-agent infrastructure's performance and enable visualizations of the process behavior and execution flow.

This pipeline provides a streamlined approach for extracting, transforming, and analyzing logs, offering valuable insights into multi-agent systems.
