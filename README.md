# Purpose
This Python package facilitates the parsing of run logs generated by [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/). During execution, logs are stored in an SQLite database in an encoded format _(using msgpack)_. These logs are then decoded and exported to a `.json` format. Subsequently, the `.json` files are transformed into `.csv` files for further analysis.

Once in `.csv` format, the data can be analyzed using methods from the [py4pm](https://processintelligence.solutions/static/api/2.7.11/index.html) library. These methods calculate specific statistics related to the multi-agent infrastructure's performance and enable visualizations of the process behavior and execution flow.

This pipeline provides a streamlined approach for extracting, transforming, and analyzing logs, offering valuable insights into multi-agent systems.
