# Purpose
This Python package facilitates the parsing of run logs generated by LangGraph. During execution, logs are stored in an SQLite database in an encoded format (using msgpack). These logs are then decoded and exported to a .log format. Subsequently, the .log files are transformed into .csv files for further analysis.

Once in .csv format, the data can be analyzed using methods from the py4pm library. These methods calculate specific statistics related to the multi-agent infrastructure's performance and enable visualizations of the process behavior and execution flow.

This pipeline provides a streamlined approach for extracting, transforming, and analyzing logs, offering valuable insights into multi-agent systems.
