With the increase in the value of household financial assets offsetting the increase in the value of household financial liabilities in 2019, household financial net worth as a share of GDP rose to 219.6% of GDP in 2019.\n However, when these adjustments are removed, there is some evidence that stockpiling took place in the first quarter (Jan to Mar) of 2019 as there was an increase of \u00a36.1 billion in stocks held by UK companies in the run-up to the UK\u2019s original exit date from the EU at the end of March.\n Household net lending in the financial account increased in 2019 for the second year in a row\nPrivate non-financial corporations\u2019 (PNFCs) net borrowing in the financial account was 1.0% of GDP in 2019 (Figure 1.12). Figure 1.5: Services output increased by 1.8% in 2019, reflecting growth in all services industries except financial and insurance activities\nBetween 2015 and 2017, there was a sharp rise in the rate of production growth, increasing from 0.3% in 2015 to 1.8% in 2017.score?\u0007V \u001d+raw_contentresponse_time@\u0000\u0366statussuccessmodel_validate_json"

With the increase in the value of household financial assets offsetting the increase in the value of household financial liabilities in 2019, household financial net worth as a share of GDP rose to 219.6% of GDP in 2019.\n However, when these adjustments are removed, there is some evidence that stockpiling took place in the first quarter (Jan to Mar) of 2019 as there was an increase of \u00a36.1 billion in stocks held by UK companies in the run-up to the UK\u2019s original exit date from the EU at the end of March.\n Household net lending in the financial account increased in 2019 for the second year in a row\nPrivate non-financial corporations\u2019 (PNFCs) net borrowing in the financial account was 1.0% of GDP in 2019 (Figure 1.12). Figure 1.5: Services output increased by 1.8% in 2019, reflecting growth in all services industries except financial and insurance activities\nBetween 2015 and 2017, there was a sharp rise in the rate of production growth, increasing from 0.3% in 2015 to 1.8% in 2017.score?\u0007V \u001d+raw_contentresponse_time@\u0000\u0366statussuccessmodel_validate_json"

However, if you can run Python code, you can use the following code to generate the line graph:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Data\nyears = [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022]\ngdp_values = [2852.52, 2697.81, 3141.51, 3088.84]\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(years, gdp_values, marker='o')\n\n# Titles and labels\nplt.title('UK GDP Over the Past 5 Years')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('GDP (in billion USD)')\n\n# Show grid\nplt.grid(True)\n\n# Display plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code utilizes the `matplotlib` library to create a line graph of the UK's GDP over the past four years. Adjust the `years` and `gdp_values` lists as necessary if more data becomes available. \n\nIf you need further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.additional_kwargsrefusalresponse_metadatatoken_usagecompletion_tokensprompt_tokens\u000bOtotal_tokens\f:completion_tokens_detailsaccepted_prediction_tokens\u0000audio_tokens\u0000reasoning_tokens\u0000rejected_prediction_tokens\u0000prompt_tokens_detailsaudio_tokens\u0000cached_tokens\n\u0000model_namegpt-4o-2024-08-06system_fingerprintfp_159d8341ccfinish_reasonstoplogprobstypeainameResearcherid*run-c6bc3ac8-a51b-4fde-b130-59185b3af7bd-0example\u00aatool_callsinvalid_tool_callsusage_metadatainput_tokens\u000bOoutput_tokenstotal_tokens\f:input_token_detailsaudio\u0000cache_read\n\u0000output_token_detailsaudio\u0000reasoning\u0000model_validate_json"

With the increase in the value of household financial assets offsetting the increase in the value of household financial liabilities in 2019, household financial net worth as a share of GDP rose to 219.6% of GDP in 2019.\n However, when these adjustments are removed, there is some evidence that stockpiling took place in the first quarter (Jan to Mar) of 2019 as there was an increase of \u00a36.1 billion in stocks held by UK companies in the run-up to the UK\u2019s original exit date from the EU at the end of March.\n Household net lending in the financial account increased in 2019 for the second year in a row\nPrivate non-financial corporations\u2019 (PNFCs) net borrowing in the financial account was 1.0% of GDP in 2019 (Figure 1.12). Figure 1.5: Services output increased by 1.8% in 2019, reflecting growth in all services industries except financial and insurance activities\nBetween 2015 and 2017, there was a sharp rise in the rate of production growth, increasing from 0.3% in 2015 to 1.8% in 2017.score?\u0007V \u001d+raw_contentresponse_time@\u0000\u0366statussuccessmodel_validate_json"
